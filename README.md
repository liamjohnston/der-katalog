My record collection. View it here:
http://derkatalog.surge.sh/

App build with React. Data stored in Firebase. Firebase also handles the (o)auth, so only I may add/edit records.

Images hosted/sourced/cropped via Cloudinary widget. Serves WebP where possible due to Cloudinary's awesomeness.

TODOs:

* Current range slider on add/edit screen is laggy. Fix this.
* Search debouncing? Seems to work OK though.
