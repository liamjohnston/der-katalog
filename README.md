My record collection. View it here:

(I am still in the middle of cataloging everything)

A work in progress... todo:

* Make better UI, especially desktop
* Choose a better font than courier new if that's possible
* Fix weird textarea resizing issue
* (maybe) Table-style sorting on list view??
* Scroll-to-top on the list page, e.g. searching, re-rendering(?)
* Finish cataloging (very time-consuming but nearly there)

App build with React. Data stored in Firebase. Firebase also handles the (o)auth, so only I may add/edit records.
