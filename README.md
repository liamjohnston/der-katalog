My record collection. 

A work in progress... todo:
- Make better UI, especially desktop
- searching, possibly sorting
- Finish cataloging records (very time-consuming)

App build with React. Data stored in Firebase. Firebase also handles the auth (oauth), so only I may add/edit records.

Images hosted/sourced/cropped via Cloudinary widget.
