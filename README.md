My record collection. View it here:

(I am still in the middle of cataloging everything)

A work in progress... todo:
- Make better UI, especially desktop
- searching, possibly sorting
- Finish cataloging records (very time-consuming)

App build with React. Data stored in Firebase. Firebase also handles the auth (oauth), so only I may add/edit records.
